I am not responsible if your tablet is bricked after applying my tool.
I tested it for the Acer Iconia B1-A71 under Windows and Linux and it works for me.
I haven't tested it on other devices. I adpoted the tool for other devices with help of their owners from XDA, Android-Hilfe and other Communities. For them, the tool works.
